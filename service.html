                                        My contribution in the process was priming and painting layers on sheets of drywall as a member of my

                                        engagement. As a member of my school’s NHS, I helped my school and community through hours of selfless service 
                                        by volunteering at the elementary schools and middle schools events in my community, guided parents whose English 
                                        isn’t their first language during school registration, and yearly trash bashes.

                                    <p class="p3">For ten years and still running I have been a part of an orchestra. I first started as a bass player for my 
                                        middle-high school for seven years and I now play for <b><a href="https://musa.tamu.edu/university-orchestras/" target="_blank" class="external">Texas A&M’s Philharmonic Orchestra</a></b>. As a high schooler and 
                                        section leader of my orchestra, I spent a lot of my time after school teaching and helping out the bass players in my 
                                        section and the players in the middle school orchestra. I helped the bass players by preparing them for their solo 
                                        competitions and I would often run our section after school practices too.

                                        volunteered to help run the academic UIL competitions for the elementary schools in my area. My involvement during the elementary 
                                        academic competitions included preparing the testing rooms, running the students through the rules, proctoring the students, and
